### CS-Swansea FAQ:

#### Why this site?

> Anyone who's been in the department for more than a week will have heard a thousand or so times from everyone about the mythical `CS-Wiki on CS-Svr1`... But how do you log onto CS-Svr1, and why should I go through all the hassle?
>
> And so the myth continues on for another generation of researchers. Maybe one day we'll embark on an expedition to find original `CS-Wiki`, if it still exists, and learn from what the ancient CS Researchers of yesteryear have to teach us.

#### Where can store my lunch? 

> We have a large kitchen on the South end of the 4th floor lab with a fridge and plenty of cupboard space. 
> There is also (I'm told) a small kitchen on the 5th floor if you're working upstairs.

#### I have my computer, but what about some tools and software?

> The university is a part of a programme with Microsoft called [DreamSpark](http://e5.onthehub.com/WebStore/ProductsByMajorVersionList.aspx?ws=03824815-ecfc-e111-bd05-f04da23e67f6&vsro=8&JSEnabled=1) which allows us to download and licence almost all of Microsofts software for non-comercial purposes. 
>
> This includes everything from IDE's like the latest version of **Visual Studio 2013 Unlimited**, operating systems ranging from **Windows XP** to **Windows 8.1**, and management tools such as **Microsoft Project** and **Visio**.
>
> If you don't have login details for DreamSpark contact our deparment IT Team.

#### I need a software licence for my work and it wasn't on Dreamspark?

>  Contact our department IT Team and they can help you with any software the department licenses.
