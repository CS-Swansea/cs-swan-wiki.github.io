title: Using the Xeon Phi rack!
---

Back in October, 2013 the department acquired a special new computer from Intel containing four of their new [Xeon Phi coproccessors](http://ark.intel.com/products/75801/Intel-Xeon-Phi-Coprocessor-5120D-8GB-1_053-GHz-60-core). 

Now after months of sitting idle the Xeon Phi rack is setup and configure for us to work with!

##Lets get started!

To get running on the Xeon Phi you'll need a couple of things:

1. A user account
2. Git
3. [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) (for windows users)
4. [MSysGit \(Git Bash\)](http://msysgit.github.io/) (for windows users)
5. Our super handy `setup_project.sh` script

### 1. Getting a user account

To get a user account simply contact:

1. [Joss Whittle](mailto:637342@swansea.ac.uk?Subject=Xeon%20Phi%20access) (Me) - I sit at the desk next to the 4th floor kitchen / the printer
2. [Damion Theobald](mailto:637342@swansea.ac.uk?Subject=Xeon%20Phi%20access) - You can find him in the IT Room on 4th floor
