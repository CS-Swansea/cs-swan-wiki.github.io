title: Using the Xeon Phi rack!
---

Back in October, 2013 the department acquired a special new computer from Intel containing four of their new [Xeon Phi coproccessors](http://ark.intel.com/products/75801/Intel-Xeon-Phi-Coprocessor-5120D-8GB-1_053-GHz-60-core). However, since then it's sat in the server room idle and unconfigured.

*Until now.*
