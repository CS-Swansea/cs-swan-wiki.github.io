The research group is proud to announce the revival of the "monday reading group". The aim of the group is to meet once a week and to each take 5-10 minutes to discuss an interesting paper we've recently read. 

## What topics should papers be on?

Anything related to computer science or your research. That said, if you've stumbled upon a truely interesting paper in one of our neighboring fields then please bring it along. 

## I'd like to attend, but have not got a paper prepared...

Absolutely fine. While we'd like to encourage everyone to contribute a paper they've read recently and found interesting, it is by no means mandatory. Come along for the discussion and to hear about interesting papers others have found. *Also coffee. Lots of coffee..*

## Time and Location

Meetings of the reading group will be on Mondays at `4pm in the 4th floor kitchen of Faraday Tower`. All are welcome.

## Want to find a paper discussed in the group?
