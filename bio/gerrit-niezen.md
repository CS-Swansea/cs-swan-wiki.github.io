I'm a postdoctoral researcher in human-computer interaction working on the [CHI+MED](http://chi-med.ac.uk) project. My research looks at the interaction design and user interfaces of medical devices, focusing on improving their safety and usability. I'm also interested in the role that open source hardware can play in improving the safety of these devices.
